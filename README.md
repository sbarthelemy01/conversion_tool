# Conversion Tool
## Introduction
This tool allows users to calculate different types of conversions (temperature, distance, weight, size, currency, etc.) all from one page. Compared to using Google and other search engines to look up calculators to switch between units of measurement or to find formulas, this program will simplify the process. Additionally, all but three of the 195 countries use the metric system as the primary system of measurement. Thus, it is important to implement an application that can do all these calculations in one space.
